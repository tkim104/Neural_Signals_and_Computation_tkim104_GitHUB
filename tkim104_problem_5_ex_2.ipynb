Matrix factorization has emerged as an alternative approach for identifying ROIs from the full spatio-temporal video. Here we will explore three different types of factorization and compare the results using a table.\n","\n","## Part B:\n","Run NMF on the pixels-by-time matrix as in part A, for a specific number of components that you find reasonable. What are the differences that you note? Is there a similar dependency on the rank of the decomposition?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true,"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","output_embedded_package_id":"1dJWyU_ngMx7ECq1QoqTMOLQmd8a1qNWv"},"id":"YaW42MB7fZxZ","outputId":"56246b55-40b3-4d9b-8b74-6065cfeb30cc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import plotly\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import tifffile\n","from google.colab import drive\n","from PIL import Image\n","import numpy as np\n","import sklearn\n","from sklearn import cluster, decomposition\n","\n","# Find the tif file in google drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","file = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Neural_Signals_and_Computation_HW1/TEST_MOVIE_00001-small.tif\"\n","\n","# Load tif file into numpy array and image\n","data = tifffile.imread(file)\n","\n","# Vectorize each frame into a column vector thenc combine each column together\n","# Matrix -\u003e (500*500, 500) or (MN, T)\n","full_data = []\n","for k in range(len(data)):\n","  column = np.array(data[k]).flatten()\n","  full_data.append(column)\n","full_data = np.array(full_data).transpose()\n","\n","# Create a square layout for the plot\n","layout = go.Layout(\n","    width=data.shape[1],  # Set the width of the plot\n","    height=data.shape[2],  # Set the height of the plot\n","    xaxis=dict(range=[0, data.shape[1]]),  # Set the x-axis range to match the width of the image\n","    yaxis=dict(range=[0, data.shape[2]]),  # Set the y-axis range to match the height of the image\n","    margin=dict(l=0, r=0, t=0, b=0),  # Set the margins to 0 to remove unnecessary spacing\n",")\n","\n","# Check when we choose number of components k = 2 to 7\n","for i in range(1):\n","  n_components = i + 2\n","\n","  nmf_estimator = decomposition.NMF(n_components=n_components, tol=5e-3)\n","  pca_result_mn = nmf_estimator.fit_transform(full_data)  # original non- negative dataset\n","  pca_result_f = nmf_estimator.components_\n","\n","  result = np.matmul(pca_result_mn, pca_result_f)\n","\n","  nmf_data = []\n","  for j in range(result.shape[1]):\n","    nmf_data.append(result[:, j].reshape((500, 500)))\n","  nmf_data = np.array(nmf_data)\n","\n","  # Plot the summary images\n","  print(\"Using \" + str(i + 2) + \" components: \")\n","  fig_mean = go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(z=nmf_data[0]), layout=layout)\n","  fig_mean.show()\n","\n","# Original Data Image Frame 0\n","print(\"Original Data\")\n","fig_mean = go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(z=data[0]), layout=layout)\n","fig_mean.show()"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNpBD0RdOPE6jJ1eIHJOilN","name":"","version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
