However, one could argue that the average intensity may miss smaller spikes in activity or other details from only taking the average, thus if the cells appears to be always excited, it'll be harder to distinguish in the plot generated for that time trace. Overall, one could test if their time-trace is accurate by comparing the data to other ground truths, possible utilizing single neuron recording or spiking information and see if it matches well with not only the calcium images, but also the generated time trace. There may be a possibility where the region of interest itself may have errors in correctly analzying cells and reflecting the actual activity in the video."],"metadata":{"id":"zAJ2b13aftZQ"}}]}
